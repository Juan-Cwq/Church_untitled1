# Customer Avatar: The Problem Aware Christian Seeker

This customer avatar, **"The Problem Aware Christian Seeker,"** is designed for the second stage of market awareness as defined by Eugene Schwartz in *Breakthrough Advertising*. This individual is acutely aware of a problem in their life—a deep-seated need for **connection and community** within their church—but they are not yet aware that a **digital platform/website** is the specific solution. Their internal monologue is focused on the *pain* of disconnection, not the *tool* that can solve it.

## D → Smart Market Questions: The Pain Points

Sarah's Problem Aware state means her pain is emotional and relational, not technical. She doesn't think, "I need a better website." She thinks, **"I feel lonely in a crowded room."**

| Question Category | Sarah's Inner World |
| :--- | :--- |
| **What keeps them awake at night, eyes open, staring at the ceiling** | "Am I investing enough in my faith life? I go to church, but I don't *know* anyone. If I had a crisis tomorrow, who would I call? We're just going through the motions." |
| **What are they secretly afraid of in life** | That she will look back on her life and realize she was too busy to build deep, lasting, authentic relationships—especially within her church community. She fears being a "Sunday-only Christian." |
| **What are they angry about, and who are they angry at** | She is angry at the **friction and disorganization** of her church's communication. She is angry at the *system*, not the people. "Why is it so hard to find a group? Why do I have to search three different places to sign up for the retreat? It makes me feel like the church doesn't *really* want me to connect." |
| **Top 3 frustrations they feel every day** | 1. **Information Overload/Scarcity:** She hears about a small group/event *after* it started or is full. 2. **Wasted Time:** She spends 20 minutes clicking through old PDFs and broken links on the church site just to find the women's ministry calendar. 3. **The "New Kid" Feeling:** She's been attending for a year, but still feels like an outsider because she can't easily find a consistent group to join. |
| **Biggest secret desire in life** | To be an integral, connected, and valued member of a vibrant, supportive Christian community where she can both receive and offer genuine support. |
| **Built-in bias to how they make decisions** | **Efficiency and Trust.** She will choose the path of least resistance if it is clearly presented by a trusted authority (like her church leadership). She is biased against anything that feels like a time-waster or a disorganized mess. |
| **Common words or language unique to them** | "Authentic community," "discipleship," "spiritual discipline," "doing life together," "intentional living," "friction," "bandwidth," "I need a better system." |
| **Top 3 complaints about existing solutions** | 1. "The church website is a graveyard of old information." 2. "I get 10 emails a week, but the one thing I need—the small group list—is always buried in a PDF attachment." 3. "I don't want to cold-email a random small group leader I've never met. I wish I could see what the group is like before I commit." |

## E → Going Deep: Emotional Landscape

The Problem Aware stage is defined by the emotional weight of the problem. Sarah feels the *lack* of connection deeply.

| Emotion Category | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Top 3 Dominant Negative Emotions** | **Loneliness/Isolation** (The most dominant, spiritual and social); **Frustration** (with the effort required to connect); **Guilt** (for not being "more plugged in" or "more proactive"). |
| **Top 3 Dominant Positive Emotions From Solving This Problem** | **Relief** (The burden of searching is gone); **Belonging/Acceptance** (She is finally "in" the community); **Spiritual Fulfillment** (Her faith life feels integrated and supported). |
| **Top 3 Beliefs They Hold About The World** | 1. **"The world is isolating, and true community is rare and worth fighting for."** 2. **"My church *wants* me to connect, but they are overwhelmed and don't know how to make it easy."** 3. **"Technology is a necessary evil, but it should serve connection, not replace it."** |
| **Biggest Lifestyle Desire** | A life where her spiritual and social needs are seamlessly met by her church community, allowing her to move from being a passive attendee to an active, supported participant. |

## F → Purchasing Habits

Since the offer is a church-provided digital platform, the "purchase" is her **commitment and adoption** of the tool, and the "price" is her **time and trust**.

| Purchasing Habit | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Top 3 Decision Triggers** | 1. **A Moment of Acute Loneliness:** (e.g., a personal setback where she realizes she has no one to call). 2. **A Direct, Clear Call to Action:** (e.g., a pastor saying, "If you want to join a group, go to *one* place: the new Church Connect Hub"). 3. **Social Proof:** (e.g., a friend saying, "I finally found my small group through the new app—it's so easy!"). |
| **Prior Purchases For This Pain** | Subscriptions to Christian meditation apps (e.g., Abide); Buying books on community and spiritual growth; Attending one-off church events that ultimately didn't lead to lasting connection. |
| **Price Tolerance For Offer** | **$0.00.** The offer must be free and provided by the church. Her tolerance is for the *effort* required: it must be less than 5 minutes to find and sign up for a group. |
| **Time Horizon Of Solution** | **Immediate.** She needs to feel the *possibility* of connection within 24 hours of engaging with the solution, and she expects to be fully integrated into a group within 2 weeks. |

## H → Empathy Map

The empathy map captures Sarah's experience as a Problem Aware customer, highlighting the gap between her internal desire and her external reality.

| Category | Sarah's Experience |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Seeing** | The large, beautiful sanctuary on Sunday; the friendly but hurried faces after service; the confusing, cluttered church bulletin; a text message from a friend about an event she wasn't invited to; the "Small Groups" page on the website that hasn't been updated in 6 months. |
| **Thinking** | "I wish this church felt smaller." "I need to find a group, but I don't have the time to hunt for one." "I feel like I'm the only one who doesn't know what's going on." "My faith is important, but my community life is lacking." |
| **Hearing** | The pastor's sermon about the importance of "doing life together"; her friend's excited stories about their thriving small group; the sound of silence when she needs prayer or support; the general noise of a busy, disconnected world. |
| **Feeling** | **Frustrated** by the lack of clarity; **Lonely** despite being surrounded by hundreds of people; **Hopeful** that a solution exists; **Overwhelmed** by the effort required to get involved. |
| **Saying** | "I'm just so busy." "I need to look into that small group thing." "The website is so hard to navigate." "I wish there was one place to find everything." |
| **Doing** | Attending Sunday service faithfully; occasionally checking the church's main social media feed; trying to find a group once a month and giving up after 15 minutes of searching; praying for more community. |

## Avatar Summary: The Problem Aware Pitch

The pitch to Sarah must focus entirely on her pain and how the solution removes the friction she is currently experiencing.

**The Headline (Addressing the Problem):**
> **"Stop Feeling Like a Stranger in Your Own Church. The Connection You Crave is Only One Click Away."**

**The Copy (Validating her frustration):**
> *You know you need community. You know the Bible calls us to "do life together." But every time you try to find a small group, sign up for a retreat, or volunteer, you hit a wall of broken links, outdated PDFs, and confusing email chains. You're not lazy—the system is broken.*

**The Transition (Introducing the Solution as a Relief):**
> *Imagine a single, simple, beautiful hub where every opportunity for connection—from small groups to retreats to service—is clearly organized, instantly searchable, and ready for you to join. **No more hunting. No more frustration. Just community.** This is the dedicated platform your church built to eliminate the friction and finally make connection easy.*

**The Offer (The Benefit):**
> **The Church Connection Hub:** Your single, simple source for finding and joining the perfect small group, event, or volunteer opportunity in less than 5 minutes. **Finally, feel fully plugged in.**

This avatar, at over 1000 words, provides the necessary depth to craft compelling copy that speaks directly to Sarah's Problem Aware state, focusing on her emotional pain (loneliness, frustration) and her desire for relief (clarity, belonging, ease). The copy should not yet focus on the *features* of the website (e.g., "our database integration"), but on the *result* of those features (e.g., "no more hunting").<ctrl95><ctrl42>call:default_api:plan{action:
